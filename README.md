# **Example Angular blog built with Scully SSG**

A sample blog app developed with Angular and built as a static site using
Scully SSG (static site generator). Blog posts are written in markdown files and
converted to static html by Scully's build process.

Scully is a static site generator tool for Angular to build, test and deploy
Jamstack apps.


Instructions for developing and scaffolding, building, and testing this project
are found below.

## **Development server**


## **Run Angular Static Site App with Blog Posts**

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:1668/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## **Run Angular App Only (without SSG, blog posts)**


Run `npm run _start:ng` for an angular dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## **Code scaffolding**


Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.


## **Build**


### **Build App as Static Site** (Using Angular CLI + Scully)


Run `ng build` to build the project as static-site, generated by first building
the app using the angular-cli and then building the static site using Scully
SSG (static site generator). The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

<br>

Run `ng build:ssg` to build the project as static-site only using scully. Note
that the scully build depends on the angular build to have been run first,
(either by running `npm run build:ng` or `npm run build`) using the
angular-cli before. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


### **Build App as Angular project** (Using Angular CLI Only)


Run `ng build:ng` to build the project using the angular-cli only.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## **Running Tests**


### **Unit tests**


Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


### **End-to-end tests**


Run `npm run test:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.
To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
